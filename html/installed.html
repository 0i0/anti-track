  <h1>Welcome to anti-track</h1>
  <p>
    anit-track is a browser extension to limit the amount of data that you leak while surfing
    it is by default configured to remove the cookies which are send to google when you search while loggedin to gmail
  </p>
  <p>
    the way it works is that it is configurde to blacklist sites using regular expressions
    you can than easy the blacklisting by providing whitelist filters
    </p>
  <p>

    for example:<br/>
      black list all domains matching the word: <b>google.</b> (this include google.com, www.google.de, mail.google.com , etc)
      <br/>
      than you can white list a subset of this by providing the white list filter <b>mail.google.</b> this include (mail.google.com, mail.google.de etc)
      <br/>
      than if the host remains on the black list all cookies are removed for the request
